Prologue:

Humanity has now colonized 100% of the universe, and is the dominant force, the One Great Power. The central government of humanity lies on a common rocky planet, called RX105. No one knows where RX105 is, how it originated, or why it is important enough to make it the economical, political, and philosophical center of the universe. All of these secrets have been lost to time. Humans, using their advanced technology, have made uneasy peace with the countless other alien civilizations, keeping the universe from descending into intergalactic war. 2 delegates from each galaxy live on RX105, representing their people and culture, having "a say" in universal matters. Revolving around RX105 are 15 top-class Space Warships, ready to defend it at all costs. Technology at this point in time has ascended beyond imagination, people(using the term loosly, applies to other species as well) harness the power of quantum mechanics on a day to day basis, extracting energy from the very quantum foam of existence. This very quantum foam makes up the layers of force fields around RX105. The defenses around RX105 are displays of power, nonverbally threatening all other civilizations and species. The universe is at peace. For now.

But there is one problem.

One bad branch in the governmential tree of RX105, one evil ant in the colony.

This branch, the Fundamental BioLab.

It was not directly evil, the researchers did not have bad intentions, but messing around with the the biology of species was evil in nature. Multiple warnings have been sent to them, from scientists everywhere, but they have persisted in their research, hoping that the next big breakthrough will come to them. And come to them it did.


Year ???:

Scientist 1: ...so, according to the laws of biology, DNA affects the respiratory system is such a way that the lungs cannot function when the ABM node of the hexaspirular section is tampered with. Thus, we cannot hope to accomplish anything by changing the 55th dot of the ABM node. Let us move on to the HGW node of DNA. This affects the eyes of the human. If we change specific orderings of chromosome pairs during cellular reproduction, we may be able to give the guards the ability to manipulate X-Rays to their advantage with just flickers of the eyelobe, just as they can manipulate visible light... According to my calculations, if we transport all 23 billion residents of planet GH387-XXH into TestCraft307 near here, and try a different pair of chromosomes for each patient, we will eventually be able to find a combanation that works.

Scientist 2: (over Intercom) "All residents of planet GH387-XXH please move to TestCraft307 within the next 5 minutes. Repeat: All residents of planet GH387-XXH please move to TestCraft307 within the next 5 minutes. Those who ignore this command will be subjected to punishment."


During Experiment:
Computer AI: "Alert. Alert. We have recieved notice that all TestCrafts are prone to a form of radiation not yet discovered."

Scientist 2: How do you know?

Computer AI: "During the experiments, one of the subjects reported seeing strands of yellow radiating outward from the spacecraft. He also reported seeing the yellow in various dots in space. We have received conformation that the location of those dots are precisely the coordinates of the other TestCrafts in the universe. We speculate that we discovered a pair of chromosomes that manipulate the eyes in being able to see this form of radiation. When this pair was tested on other subjects, they reported seeing the exact same thing. We do not yet know whether or not this radiation is deadly."

Scientist 2: Then we shall wait.

Computer AI: "We have achieved progress in identifying this form of radiation. The wavelength is infintesimal. This is why we have not yet been able to detect it. The wavelength allows it to pass through every barrier. Nothing can stop it, or slow it down."

Scientist 2: How fast is it traveling?

Computer AI: "As a form of radiation, we originally thought that it would travel at the speed of light. However, as it's wavelength is on a quantum scale, we have found that it can travel quite a bit faster, or even slower. We discovered it doesn't just move with velocity, quantum entanglement helps it along. It's speed varies from negative infinity to positive invinity. It is truly random, but the probability velocity scale follows a shifted Normal Distribution pattern. The speed is most likely between 15mph and 1 billion times lightspeed."

Scientist 2: So, while it moves at the speed of light, it creates a quantum tunnel to help it warp spacetime, either forward or backward?

Computer AI: "That's right. Radiation scientists have dubbed it 'QT rays', or 'Quantum Tunneling Rays'."

Computer AI: "Notice. We have recieved further information on this radiation. Quantum Foam Force Fields are able to reflect it."

Scientist 2: That's very helpful. Do we know why our TestCrafts are emitting this form of radiation?

Computer AI: "Well, the ships are fairly new, ..." beep "RED ALERT. ALERT CODE OMEGA. ORION ALPHA DELTA. Please respond immediately."

Scientist 2: (Gasps in shock) Yes? What is it?

Computer AI: "WARNING. WARNING. QT(Quantum Tunneling) RAYS WILL CAUSE THE DESTRUCTION OF HUMANITY. THE QUANTUM BEHAVIORS CAUSE CELLULAR CANCER. DEATH TIME IS APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES. THERE IS NO CURE. TURN ON YOUR QUANTUM FOAM FORCE FIELDS IMMEDIATELY. PRAY TO GOD THAT THE QT RAYS DO NOT TRAVEL FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT DURING THE NEXT 100 BILLION YEARS. ENTER HIBERNATION UNTIL YEAR 100,000,000. THE RAYS WILL HAVE DISSAPATED BY THEN." beep "Do you wish to broadcast this message to the universe?"

Scientist 2: Oh god. Wh-what is this?

Computer AI: "I believe that the destruction of humanity is approaching, caused by humanity's own experiments. Do you wish to broadcast this message to the universe, so that people might be able to save themselves?"

Scientist 2: B-but, why shouldn't the Q-QT rays travel f-faster than light?

Computer AI: "This is simply explained: The warning travels at lightspeed, if the rays reach the target before the warning does, then then we would've wasted time and money sending out this warning."

Scientist 2: Y-yes. Ok.

Computer AI: "Do you wish to send out the warning? Remember that every second you hesitate, the QT rays travel between 22 feet and 3000000000000000 meters, or in layman's terms, a fifth of a football field to half of the universe. Please note that the fate of the human civilization is on your hands. During the time of this message, the rays would have already traveled 2 football fields or spanned the universe 5 times over. Remember, QT Rays are capable of going much faster than this, or much slower than this. There is a 99% chance that they will fall within this range."

Scientist 2: Send it.

Computer AI: "Pray that this works. Please note that Quantum Foam Force Fields are only availible to 10 of the highest ranked officers in each galaxy."

Scientist 2: Don't care. As long as a shred of humanity survives.

Computer AI: "Also, this will not affect aliens, as their biological composition is different from ours."

Scientist 2: How could we have messed up so badly?
